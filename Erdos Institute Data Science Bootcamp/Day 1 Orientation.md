Framework for parametric supervised machine learning.
Data is $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^p$, so it is represented as an $n\times p$ matrix $X$. The framework for parametric supervised machine learning is though of as a map $f:\mathbb{R}^p\to\mathbb{R}^k$ so the output is called $Y$ which is $n\times k$. We are trying to find the "true function" $f\in\mathcal{F}$ where $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of functions (such as linear functions, logistic function, or neural networks). The *parametric* part comes form the fact that this class of function $\mathcal{F}$ should be specified by some set of parameters.

For example, $f_\theta(\mathbb{x}) = \theta_0 + \mathbf{\theta}_{1,\ldots,n}\cdot \mathbf{x}$ would be in the class of linear models. We will specify a "loss function" which quantifies how well a given $f_\theta$ represents the data.
