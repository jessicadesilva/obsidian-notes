In this hands-on workshop, we'll learn how to build data ingestion pipelines. In particular, we will cover the following steps:
* Extracting data from APIs, or files.
* Normalizing and loading data.
* Incremental loading (but not incremental extraction)

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to write data pipelines like a senior data engineer: Quickly, concisely, scalable, and self-maintaining.
