**Dimensional Data Modeling**
*Complex Data Types Arrays and Structs with Iceberg*
In this lecture, we explore the fundamental concepts essential for effective data modeling and database management. We dive into understanding your data consumer, the distinctions between OLTP and OLAP data modeling, the principles of Cumulative Table design, and the tradeoff between compactness and usability. We also address challenges of temporal cardinality explosion and the potential pitfalls of run-length encoding compression. By the end of the lecture, you will have a strong foundation in the key concepts of data modeling and be prepared to apply these principles in practice.
