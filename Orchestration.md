# Architecture

1. Extract
	* Pull data from source (API - NYC Taxi dataset)
2. Transform
	* Data cleaning, transforming, and partitioning
3. Load
	* API to Mage, Mage to (Postgres, GCP, BigQuery)

# What is orchestration?
* A large part of data engineering is **extracting**, **transforming**, and **loading** data between sources.
* **Orchestration** is a process of dependency management, facilitated through **automation**.
* The data orchestrator manages scheduling, triggering, monitoring, and even resource allocation.
* Every workflow requires sequential steps
	* e.g. a french press with cold water will only brew disappointment
	* In a similar way, poorly sequenced transformations brew (haha) a storm far more bitter.
* Vocabulary
	* Steps -> Tasks
	* Workflows -> DAGS (directed acyclic graphs) or pipeline
